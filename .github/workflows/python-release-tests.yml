# We only test anemoi-training in this workflow since graphs and models are dependencies of anemoi-training but don't have dependencies in anemoi-core
# Thus the analogue workflow would result in the same tests as those run in the "Test PR" workflow
# The case that is not tested is if anemoi-models or anemoi-graphs are released, whether the current version of anemoi-training is compatible with the new version of anemoi-models or anemoi-graphs
# To check if training needs to be released as well (when releasing models/graphs), please look at the changelog of the release PRs for models/graphs
